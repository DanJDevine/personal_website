I’m primarily interested in public opinion and political attitudes, how these are formed and expressed, and their causes and consequences. I focus on political trust and similar attitudes (like democratic satisfaction). Some of the longer-term ongoing projects are described here, and the publications are predictably under 'Publications'. 

-------------------------------------

## Political trust

I’m primarily working on experiments and causality in trust research, with a more specific focus on the consequences of trust. There's some details on [Twitter here](https://twitter.com/DanJDevine/status/1359554155703119875) about trust and redistribution preferences.

### 1. What are the causal consequences and determinants of political trust? How can we determine them?

Funded by various sources, I am running experiments into the determinants of trust (through conjoint and other experiments across countries) with [TrustGov colleagues](https://trustgov.net), and consequences of trust, relating to policy preferences, support for politicians, and democratic reform. A longer-term aim is to conduct meta-analyses of causes and consequences, but this is very much a work in progress. 

### 2. What are the long-term trends and relationships in trust and related attitudes? 

One of the main focuses of research in this area has been on long-term trends, whether trust (and other attitudes) are declining, and where. I have a paper on this in [Political Research Quarterly](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10659129211009605), and working on a couple more in the same vein. 

### 3. How do people reason about trust judgements? 

How do people actually reach these judgements, both in 'reality' and when asked in surveys? This is a longer-term goal, but I'm involved in projects studying this with focus group data. 

## Voting and Political Behaviour

How do voters make decisions and what influences those decisions? What role does context play?

### 1. How does the media environment influence voting behaviour?

My first published paper was on this topic, in the [British Journal of Political Science](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0007123418000145/type/journal_article), which argues that media coverage of UKIP causally influenced UKIP poll support. I am following up on this, looking at the specific mechanisms linking media coverage and party support. 

### 2. How does international integration influence voting?

One of my focuses with respect to voting behaviour is the international environment. One recent paper on this has been whether perceived international constraints affects economic voting, which is now accepted at West European Politics, in which Cal Le Gall and I argue that perceived constraints do not attenuate performance voting in either economic or non-economic areas. 

## International integration

I'm also working more broadly on how international integration impacts mass politics. This was the topic of my PhD, and I have a few areas of interest in this too, relating to party politics and political attitudes. Work on this area includes:

### 1. What types of interventions and by which actors influence political attitudes?

Most work has focused on the Eurozone crisis and interventions by the European Union, but other types of interventions matter too. For instance, [in this paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13501763.2021.1901963?journalCode=rjpp20) we argue that European Court of Justice decisions influenced both democratic satisfaction and Euroscepticism in Spain.

### 2. Through which mechanisms do these interventions affect attitudes? 

Probably more important is why these have the effects they do. I have looked at this [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402382.2019.1675130), and have other work currently under reviews and revisions, which primarily argues that the mechanism is through people updating their views of the economic situation following intervention, though there is a role for issues of political representation and sovereigty. 

### 3. How does European integration affect party systems and representation?

My PhD focused on the above question. In [this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14651165211024936), me and Raimondas Ibenskas argue that European integration has had a minimal impact on the congruence between citizens and governing institutions in terms of ideology or issue positions. 

## Governance

I'm interested in governance as well. I've mostly done this non-academically with the [Institute for Government's Minister's Reflect](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/our-work/professional-development/ministers-reflect), which is an archive of interviews with former ministers. See for instance ['Becoming Secretary of State'](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/becoming-secretary-of-state-final.pdf), which describes in ministers' own words what happens when becoming SoS and advice to do it well. Most recently I have worked on designing a new electoral single transferable vote electoral system for local elections in Wales, which is published [here](https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/statistics-and-research/2021-03/implementation-of-a-single-transferable-vote-system-for-local-elections-in-wales.pdf).
