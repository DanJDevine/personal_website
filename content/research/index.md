I’m primarily interested in public opinion and political attitudes, how these are formed and expressed, and their causes and consequences. I focus on political trust and similar attitudes (like democratic satisfaction). Some of the longer-term ongoing projects are described here.

-------------------------------------

## Political trust

In the context of [TrustGov](https://trustgov.net), an ESRC large-grant project, and on the back of my PhD, I’m working on a number of broad areas in political trust. I’m primarily working on experiments and causality in trust research.

1. What are the causal consequences and determinants of political trust? How can we determine them?
2. How do people make and reason about trust judgements?
3. How does international integration – including explicit interventions – impact political trust?
4. How does trust in institutions operate in multilevel governance?
5. What are the long-term trends and relationships in trust and related attitudes? 

## Voting and Political Behaviour

How do voters make decisions and what influences those decisions? What role does context play?

1. How does the media environment influence voting behaviour?
2. How does international integration influence voting?

## Elite governance

I'm interested in governance as well. I've mostly done this non-academically with the [Institute for Government's Minister's Reflect](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/our-work/professional-development/ministers-reflect), which is an archive of interviews with former ministers. See for instance ['Becoming Secretary of State'](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/becoming-secretary-of-state-final.pdf), which describes in ministers' own words what happens when becoming SoS and advice to do it well.
