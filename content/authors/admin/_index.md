I'm a Fellow in Comparative Politics at [St Hilda's College](https://www.st-hildas.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. I work broadly in European and British political behaviour, focusing on public opinion and public policy. I generally use observational and experimental methods but like speaking to people as well. Alongside my academic research I also work as a consultant researcher for think tanks, charities, etc. 

You can see my research and other work-related things using the menu at the top.

I volunteer for [October Books](https://www.octoberbooks.org) an independent co-op bookshop in Southampton. If you have the money and inclination, order your books through them!
