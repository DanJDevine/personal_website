I have experience teaching through lectures, seminars, tutorials and workshops, across most subfields of political science. 

## 2020/2021 

I'm currently teaching *Practice of Politics* and *Political Sociology* to PPE and History and Politics undergraduate students at Oxford. These cover the main bases of political science and some topics more in depth such as voting behaviour, media influence, and value change.

## Previous years

### Tutorials

I have taught seminars in global governance, comparative politics, and introduction to politics to undergraduates at all levels at the *University of Southampton*. 

### Lectures

I have co-convened and lectured on a second/third year undergraduate module in *Political Behaviour* at the University of Southampton, and also given lectures on (quantitative) research design to students preparing their dissertations.

### Workshops

Workshops are probably the best way to learn methods and I have delivered these academically and externally, such as at the *Open Society European Policy Institute* and *Institute for Government*.
