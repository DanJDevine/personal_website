I usually work with charities, think tanks and similar organisations helping with their research. Projects have included ongoing work with the [Open Society European Policy Institute](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/who-we-are/programs/open-society-european-policy-institute), the [Institute for Government](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk) and the Welsh Parliament. Most recently I along with colleagues studied how best to implement a new electoral system in Welsh elections. 

These have all involved quantitative work (e.g public opinion data) and interviews, workshops, site visits and desk research. 

If you're interested in this or want to pay me to do similar I'd be very happy to hear from you!
